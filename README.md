# GreenSpeed Project 


* Green Speed is an innovative program designed to help users plan eco-friendly transportation by analyzing and predicting traffic frequency, suggesting optimal travel times, and ultimately reducing carbon footprints.
* By minimizing traffic congestion, Green Speed helps reduce the volume of vehicle emissions per unit of time, making transportation more sustainable and efficient.

This project was developed during the Hack4Climate Hackathon to contribute to the global movement for climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability.

## Project Overview
* Green Speed aims to optimize travel routes and schedules for individuals and organizations to reduce their environmental impact.
* The program predicts traffic congestion patterns and suggests optimal travel times to ensure smoother commutes, reducing overall emissions. By using advanced analytics and machine learning, Green Speed empowers users to make informed decisions about their travel plans.

## Key Features:
* Traffic Frequency Analysis: Analyzes traffic data to predict congestion patterns and helps users avoid peak traffic hours.
* Optimal Travel Times: Recommends the best times to travel based on real-time traffic predictions and historical data.
* Carbon Footprint Reduction: Provides users with insights on how to reduce their carbon emissions by choosing routes and times with minimal traffic.
* Eco-Friendly Route Suggestions: Suggests alternative routes to avoid high-emission areas and traffic jams.
